## Overview
The project includes Python scripts that leverage Azure SDKs and services to:
- Deploy Azure resources such as Virtual Machines and Networking components.
- Ingest and analyze data stored in Azure Blob Storage.
- Perform data processing and aggregation using Pandas.
- Visualize the processed data using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Export and upload results back to Azure Blob Storage.

## Contents
- **Python Scripts**: The repository contains Python scripts for various Azure Data Engineering tasks, such as deploying infrastructure, processing data, and managing storage.
- **Environment Configuration**: The `.env` file is used to manage sensitive configuration details securely.
- **Data Analysis**: Scripts for processing data, generating plots, and storing results.

## Requirements
To run the scripts, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Azure SDK for Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Azure CLI (optional for direct VM operations)

## Instructions
